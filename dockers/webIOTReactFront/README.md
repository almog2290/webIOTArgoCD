# webIOTReactFront - KneeTherapy
This project is based on the Material UI (MUI) - Basic Template. 
We used the MUI framework to build our models and logic. 

## DashBoard Platform Preview
KneeThreapy is a system for real-time monitoring and display of knee training.
The panel also displays analytics of the 10 best workouts performed.
The dashboard is based on a template design of an MVP with a Live Training Session.
